kbd-state-mon
-------------

kbd-state-mon is designed for use with an X11 panel such as xmobar
that can receive text via the stdout of a program.

Whenever keyboard modifier keys are pressed, kbd-state-mon outputs
the current state of all keyboard latches and locks.

kbd-state-mon was forked from [ledmon](https://github.com/jgoerzen/ledmon).
